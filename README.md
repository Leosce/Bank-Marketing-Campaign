# Bank-Marketing-Campaign
In this project, I worked with the Bank Marketing Dataset to analyze and improve the effectiveness of a financial institution's marketing campaigns. The dataset provides various attributes related to the bank's previous marketing efforts. My primary focus was on cleaning the data, enhancing its quality and extracting meaningful insights.
